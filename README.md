# Yelp Camp
A Yelp-like website using JavaScript, touching on JQuery and EJS templating.

This was created as part of the the Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy found here: https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/.

The front-end is built mostly using EJS templating with Bootstrap, while the back-end is Node.js, utilizing the Express library and Passport for authentication.

The database is MongoDB, hosted on mLab, and accessed using the mongoose library. While a NoSQL db is not needed for something so small, it was chosen to provide practice with the NoSQL workflow.
